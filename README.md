# Wearable Foundation Modeling project

This research focuses on data collected from wearable devices like smartwatches. These devices continuously monitor health and lifestyle information provided by consenting participants, such as physical activity, heart rate, and sleep patterns. Using this data, we are building cutting-edge machine learning models based on the Transformer architecture (the same technology behind tools like ChatGPT) to better understand how daily habits impact health. This research has the potential to provide deeper insights into disease prevention and health optimization.

Under development at the Segal Lab, Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science.
